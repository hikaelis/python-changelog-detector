+ gh-124309:
+ Fixed
+ AssertionError
+ when
+ using
+ asyncio.staggered.staggered_race()
+ with
+ asyncio.eager_task_factory.
+ gh-116510:
+ Fix
+ a
+ crash
+ caused
+ by
+ immortal
+ interned
+ strings
+ being
+ shared
+ between
+ sub-interpreters
+ that
+ use
+ basic
+ single-phase
+ init.
+ In
+ that
+ case,
+ the
+ string
+ can
+ be
+ used
+ by
+ an
+ interpreter
+ that
+ outlives
+ the
+ interpeter
+ that
+ created
+ and
+ interned
+ it.
+ For
+ interpreters
+ that
+ share
+ obmalloc
+ state,
+ also
+ share
+ the
+ interned
+ dict
+ with
+ the
+ main
+ interpreter.
